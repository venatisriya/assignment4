# Assignment4
## Sriya Reddy
In this assignment, I input the matrices as given in the data for each row using the following code. 
```
> Frequency <- c(0.6,0.3,0.4,0.4,0.2,0.6,0.3,0.4,0.9,0.2)
> BP <- c(103,87,32,42,59,109,78,205,135,176)
> First <- c(1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1)
> Second <- c(0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1)
> FinalDecision <- c(0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1)
```
I then created the boxplots for each variable with the code.
```
> boxplot(x=Frequency)
> boxplot(x=BP)
> boxplot(x=First)
> boxplot(x=Second)
> boxplot(x=FinalDecision)
```
The boxplots I obtained are shown below.
